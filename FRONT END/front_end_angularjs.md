2009 saw Google launch its “brainchild”, open source client-side web framework. Angular Js was released for angular developers with the primary purpose of addressing single page application creation challenges .
It simplifies development by providing a reliable framework for Client-side Model View Controller (MVC). Google  is providing an official style guide and best practices, but it remains that the most comprehensive and popular AngularJS are from the AngularJS community itself. 

# ------------- Why AngularJS
The Angular architecture allows an easy and automatic data synchronization between the model view and the components.
Angular templates are rendered just like the traditional plain HTML. Included extended HTML terminologies carry instructions on how to project the model into view.
An inbuilt dependency injection subsystem allows the user to ask for dependencies. This is quicker and easier than having to look for them, which translates to faster Angular app development and testing.
Angular is made to be testable from the initial development stages all the way up.
Angular views are simple HTML pages. JavaScript controllers are responsible for the processing.


# Angular data binding
In Angular Js, the model and the view are linked to allow automatic data synchronization between the two.  Sitepoint explains how the two way data-binding in Angular JS works. Any changes to the view are instantly propagated on to the model and vice versa.This property makes Angular app development less demanding as the programming model is simplified for the coder.

# Angular modular development
Building modular rich client side applications that are well structured is now possible with Angular.  Modules are created in separate Js files and are essential in separation of logic. They play a vital role of keeping the code organized. Examples of Angular Js modules include controllers, applications and services. Every part of the application is kept in a separate container to keep the code clean.
